This is the original proposal for the "Quantum ugly duckling"

# Abstract
Noise in qubit is often considered a nuisance in the quantum application. But our ugly duckling is sometimes getting attention for its possibility of producing random numbers or producing unexpected creative results in quantum deep learning.   
Let's hack to see whether our ugly duckling can successfully become a goose or not.

# Description 
We are living in the NISQ era. Noise says, "I am inevitable," but we want to give the finger snap. There have been several attempts to make the existing noise useful, but in this project, we want to maximize the current noise and explore use cases for this high noise.   

### Mission 0) Set up the environment   
If we "really" want to build a new dad-joke jukebox, where would we store our precious "dad jokes"?    
We can consider building our database by using IBM Cloud (ex: Cloudant https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/cloudant ) or may choose others.

### Mission 1) Build high noise.   
Can we make a noise by control the qubit pulse? Or can we build a circuit to amplifying the existing noise(qubit noise and gate noise)?    

### Mission 2) Find application.    
How can we make this big noise useful? Can we create a "more random" dad-joke jukebox with QRNG with high noise circuit? In this case, would the QRNG pass the NIST static test?    
Or can we make a creative dad-joke with Quantum NLP with our discord channel's dad-joke?

# Deliverable
A jupyter notebook containing a QRNG. Depending on the teamwork, it may be possible to continue further research on publishing or present at the conference. Or a more random dad-joke jukebox!

# What skills are you looking for?
Anyone interested in qubit noise. (Need one person who familiar with DB or IBM Cloud). People who don't like dad-joke can have a hard time working on this project.   
Welcome newbies.
